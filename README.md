# üè¶ Conestransfer Cybersecurity Project ‚Äì CIA Response Plan

## üìå Project Overview
This project simulates the security design of **Conestransfer Inc.**, a fictitious Canadian financial technology (FinTech) company specializing in money transfers. The company operates across **Toronto (HQ)**, **Vancouver**, and **Ottawa**, with 150 employees.  

The goal of the project was to design and analyze the company‚Äôs **network infrastructure** and apply the **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad** to protect its critical assets. We also evaluated **threats, vulnerabilities, mitigations, and team structures (Red/Blue/Purple Teams)** to strengthen Conestransfer‚Äôs security posture.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Assets & Risk Prioritization
| Asset              | Threats                  | CIA Priority | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategies |
|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------|------------|-----------------------|
| Customer PII       | Phishing, Insider Threats| Confidentiality | High | AES-256 encryption, RBAC, employee training |
| Transaction Servers| DDoS, Ransomware         | Availability   | High | Air-gapped backups, Zero Trust, DDoS protection |
| API Gateways       | SQL Injection, API Abuse | All CIA       | Medium | OAuth 2.0, rate limiting, pen testing |

## üåê Network Topology
The Conestransfer enterprise network was modeled in **Cisco Packet Tracer** using a **hub-and-spoke VPN architecture**:  

- **Toronto HQ (192.168.10.0/24):** Core services (DNS/DHCP, Email, Transaction Servers, SOC team).  
- **Vancouver Office (192.168.20.0/24):** AI/ML fraud detection servers, software engineers.  
- **Ottawa Office (192.168.30.0/24):** DevOps server (CI/CD for AWS/Azure) and bilingual support center.  

üîê **Connectivity:** Offices are linked by **IPSec Site-to-Site VPNs** with AES-256 encryption.  
üõ°Ô∏è **Security Layers:** Cisco ASA Firewalls, IDS/IPS, VLAN segmentation.  

---

## üîí CIA Protections
**Confidentiality**  
- AES-256 for data at rest, TLS/IPSec for transit.  
- MFA, RBAC, and SSH key authentication.  
- VLAN segmentation, ACLs, DNSSEC, API token rotation.  

**Integrity**  
- Digital signatures, file integrity monitoring (FIM).  
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC for email validation.  
- Immutable SIEM logs and change approval workflows.  

**Availability**  
- Redundant servers (DNS/DHCP, email, transaction).  
- DDoS protection with rate limiting & IPS.  
- RAID storage, UPS backup, failover VPN routes, load balancing.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Threats & Mitigation
- **Transaction Servers:** SQL injection, brute force ‚Üí input validation, WAF, MFA.  
- **Email Systems:** Phishing, ransomware ‚Üí awareness training, spam filters, DKIM/SPF.  
- **DNS/DHCP:** Cache poisoning, amplification ‚Üí DNSSEC, query rate limiting.  
- **VPNs:** Weak PSKs, replay attacks ‚Üí certificate-based auth, strong ciphers, MFA.  
- **AI Servers:** Model poisoning, adversarial inputs ‚Üí sandbox testing, monitoring.  

---

## üë©‚Äçüíª Cybersecurity Team Structure
- **Blue Team (Defense & Monitoring):** SIEM monitoring, patching, VPN tunnel health, backups, IR protocols.  
- **Red Team (Offensive Testing):** Penetration tests, phishing simulations, misconfiguration checks.  
- **Purple Team (Coordination):** Bridge between Red & Blue, run tabletop exercises, SOC drills, metrics.  

This **three-team model** ensures proactive defense, rapid response, and continuous improvement.
